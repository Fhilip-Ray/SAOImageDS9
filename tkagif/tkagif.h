   * algorithm D (vol. 3, sec. 6.4) along with G. Knott's relatively-prime
   * secondary probe. Here, the modular division first probe is gives way to
   * a faster exclusive-or manipulation. Also do block compression with an
   * adaptive reset, whereby the code table is cleared when the compression
   * ratio decreases, but after the table fills. The variable-length output
   * codes are re-sized at this point, and a special CLEAR code is generated
   * for the decompressor. Late addition: construct the table according to
   * file size for noticeable speed improvement on small files. Please
   * direct questions about this implementation to ames!jaw.
