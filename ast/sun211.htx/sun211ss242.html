<h4 class="ssth4">Description: </h4><div class="sstvalues"> The coordinate system represented by a <a 
href="sun211ss474.html#x501-6930000">Region</a> may be changed by assigning
new values to attributes such as <a 
href="sun211ss413.html#x439-6310000">System</a>, Unit, etc. For instance, a Region representing
an area on the sky in ICRS coordinates may have its System attribute changed so that it
represents (say) Galactic coordinates instead of ICRS. This attribute controls what
happens when the coordinate system represented by a Region is changed in this
way.
                                                                                       

                                                                                       
<!--l. 33771--><p class="noindent" >If Adaptive is non-zero (the default), then area represented by the Region adapts to
the new coordinate system. That is, the numerical values which define the area
represented by the Region are changed by mapping them from the old coordinate system
into the new coordinate system. Thus the Region continues to represent the same
physical area.
<!--l. 33771--><p class="noindent" >If Adaptive is zero, then area represented by the Region does not adapt to the new
coordinate system. That is, the numerical values which define the area represented by
the Region are left unchanged. Thus the physical area represented by the Region will
usually change.
<!--l. 33771--><p class="noindent" >As an example, consider a Region describe a range of wavelength from 2000 Angstrom to
4000 Angstrom. If the Unit attribute for the Region is changed from Angstrom to <code>&#x0022;</code> nm<code>&#x0022;</code>
(nanometre), what happens depends on the setting of Adaptive. If Adaptive is
non-zero, the <a 
href="sun211ss459.html#x486-6780000">Mapping</a> from the old to the new coordinate system is found. In this
case it is a simple scaling by a factor of 0.1 (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm).
This Mapping is then used to modify the numerical values within the Region,
changing 2000 to 200 and 4000 to 400. Thus the modified region represents 200
nm to 400 nm, the same physical space as the original 2000 Angstrom to 4000
Angstrom. However, if Adaptive had been zero, then the numerical values would not
have been changed, resulting in the final Region representing 2000 nm to 4000
nm.
<!--l. 33771--><p class="noindent" >Setting Adaptive to zero can be necessary if you want correct inaccurate attribute
settings in an existing Region. For instance, when creating a Region you may not know
what <a 
href="sun211ss285.html#x311-5030000">Epoch</a> value to use, so you would leave Epoch unset resulting in some default
value being used. If at some later point in the application, the correct Epoch
value is determined, you could assign the correct value to the Epoch attribute.
However, you would first need to set Adaptive temporarily to zero, because
otherwise the area represented by the Region would be Mapped from the spurious
default Epoch to the new correct Epoch, which is not what is required.  </div> <dl class="sst">Type: </dl><dd class="sst">
