<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >Welcome to the AST library. If you are writing software for astronomy and need to use celestial
coordinates (<em>e.g.</em>&#x00A0;RA and Dec), spectral coordinates (<em>e.g.</em>&#x00A0;wavelength, frequency, <em>etc.</em>), or
other coordinate system information, then this library should be of interest. It provides
solutions for most of the problems you will meet and allows you to write robust and flexible
software. It is able to read and write WCS information in a variety of formats, including

 id="x2-40001"></a>What Problems Does AST Tackle?</h4>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >Here are some of the main problems you may face when handling world coordinate system (WCS)
information and the solutions that AST provides:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
1. The Variety of Coordinate Systems </dt><dd 
class="description"><br 
class="newline" />Astronomers  use  a  wide  range  of  differing  coordinate  systems  to  describe  positions
     within  a  variety  of  physical  domains.  For  instance,  there  are  a  large  number  of
     celestial  coordinate  systems  in  use  within  astronomy  to  describe  positions  on  the  sky.
     Understanding  these,  and  knowing  how  to  convert  coordinates  between  them,  can
     require  considerable  expertise.  It  can  also  be  difficult  to  decide  which  of  them  your
     software  should  support.  The  same  applies  to  coordinate  systems  describing  other
     domains, such as position within an electro-magnetic spectrum.
                                                                                       

                                                                                       
     <!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" ><b>Solution.</b>  AST  has  built-in  knowledge  of  many  coordinate  systems  and  allows  you
     to  convert  freely  between  them  without  specialist  knowledge.  This  avoids  the  need
     to  embed  details  of  specific  coordinate  systems  in  your  software.  You  also  benefit
     automatically when new coordinate systems are added to AST.
     </dd><dt class="description">
2. Storing and Retrieving WCS Information </dt><dd 
class="description"><br 
class="newline" />Storing  coordinate  system  information  in  astronomical  datasets  and  retrieving  it  later
     can present a considerable challenge. Typically, it requires knowledge of rather complex
     conventions (<em>e.g.</em>&#x00A0;FITS) which are low-level, often mis-interpreted and may be subject to
     change. Exchanging information with other software systems is further complicated by
     the number of different conventions in use.
     <!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" ><b>Solution.</b> AST combines a unifying high-level description of WCS information with the
     ability to save and restore this using a variety of formats. Details of the formats, which
     include FITS, are handled internally by AST. This frees you from the need to understand
     them or embed the details in your software. Again, you benefit automatically when new
     formats are added to AST.
     </dd><dt class="description">
3. Generating Graphical Output </dt><dd 
class="description"><br 
class="newline" />Producing graphical displays involving curvilinear coordinate systems, such as celestial
     coordinate  grids,  can  be  complicated.  Particular  difficulties  arise  when  handling  large
     areas of sky, the polar regions and discontinuous (<em>e.g.</em>&#x00A0;segmented) sky projections. Even
     just numbering and labelling curvilinear axes is rarely straightforward.
     <!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" ><b>Solution.</b>  AST  provides  plotting  facilities  especially  designed  for  use  with  curvilinear
     coordinate systems. These include the plotting of axes and complete labelled coordinate
     grids. A large number of options are provided for tailoring the output to your specific
     needs. Three dimensional coordinate grids can also be produced.
     </dd><dt class="description">
4. Aligning Data from Different Sources </dt><dd 
class="description"><br 
class="newline" />One of the main uses of coordinate systems is to facilitate the inter-comparison of data
     from different sources. A typical use might be to plot (say) radio contours over an optical
     image. In practice, however, different celestial coordinate systems may have been used,
     making accurate alignment far from simple.
     <!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" ><b>Solution</b> AST provides a one-step method of aligning datasets, searching for all possible
     intermediate coordinate systems. This makes it simple to directly inter-relate the pixel
     coordinates of different datasets.
     </dd><dt class="description">
5. Handling Different Types of Coordinate <a 
href="sun211ss413.html#x439-6310000">System</a> </dt><dd 
class="description"><br 
class="newline" />Not  all  coordinate  systems  used  in  astronomy  are  celestial  ones,  so  if  you  are  writing
     general-purpose software such as (say) a display tool, you may also need to handle axes
     representing wavelength, distance, time or whatever else comes along. Obviously, you
     would prefer not to handle each one as a special case.
     <!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" ><b>Solution</b> AST uses the same flexible high-level model to describe all types of coordinate
     system. This allows you to write software that handles different kinds of coordinate axis
     without introducing special cases.</dd></dl>

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2    </span> <a 
 id="x2-50002"></a>Other Design Objectives</h4>
<!--l. 161--><p class="noindent" >As well as its scientific objectives, the AST library&#x2019;s design includes a number of technical criteria
intended to make it applicable to as wide a range of projects as possible. The main considerations are
described here:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (1) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Minimum Software Dependencies. The AST library depends on no other other software<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x2-5002f1"></a>.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (2) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Environment  Independence.  AST  is  designed  so  that  it  can  operate  in  a  variety  of
     &#x201C;programming environments&#x201D; and is not tied to any particular one. To allow this, it uses
     simple, flexible interfaces to obtain the following services:
          <ul class="itemize1">
          <li class="itemize">Data  Storage.  Data  I/O  operations  are  based  on  text  and/or  FITS  headers.  This
          makes  it  easy  to  interface  to  a  wide  variety  of  astronomical  data  formats  in  a
          machine-independent way.
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">Graphics.  Graphical  output  is  produced  <em>via</em>  a  simple  generic  graphics  interface,
          which may easily be re-implemented over different graphics systems. AST provides
          a  default  implementation  based  on  the  widely-used  PGPLOT  graphics  system
          (<a 
href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun15.htx/sun15.html?xref_" >SUN/15</a>).
          </li>
          <li class="itemize">Error  Handling.  Error  messages  are  written  to  standard  error  by  default,  but  go
          through a simple generic interface similar to that used for graphics (above). This
          permits error message delivery <em>via</em> other routes when necessary (<em>e.g.</em> in a graphical
          interface).</li></ul>
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (3) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Multiple Language Support. AST has been designed to be called from more than one language.
     Both C and Fortran interfaces are available (see <a 
href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun210.htx/sun210.html?xref_" >SUN/210</a> for the Fortran version) and use from

     is also straightforward if the C interface is included using:

     developed by Starlink which allows AST to be used from Java.

  (4) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem"><a 
href="sun211ss464.html#x491-6830000">Object</a> Oriented Design. AST uses &#x201C;object oriented&#x201D; techniques internally in order to provide a
     flexible and easily-extended programming model. A fairly traditional calling interface is
     provided, however, so that the library&#x2019;s facilities are easily accessible to programmers using C
     and Fortran.
                                                                                       

                                                                                       
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (5) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Portability. AST is implemented entirely in ANSI standard C and, when called <em>via</em> its C interface,
     makes no explicit use of any machine-dependent facilities.
     <!--l. 228--><p class="noindent" >The Fortran interface is, unavoidably, machine dependent. However, the potential for problems
     has been minimised by encapsulating the interface layer in a compact set of C macros which
     facilitate its transfer to other platforms. No Fortran compiler is needed to build the
     library.
     <!--l. 234--><p class="noindent" >Currently, AST is supported by Starlink on PC&#x00A0;Linux, Sun&#x00A0;Solaris and Tru64&#x00A0;Unix (formerly

<!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" >The library name &#x201C;AST&#x201D; stands for &#x201C;ASTrometry Library&#x201D;. The name arose when it was thought that
knowledge of &#x201C;astrometry&#x201D; (<em>i.e.</em>&#x00A0;celestial coordinate systems) would form the bulk of the library. In
fact, it turns out that astrometry forms only a minor component, but the name AST has
stuck.
